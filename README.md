KPP-Helsinki
============

This is the [KPP â€“ The Kinetic PreProcessor][1] with some small 
modifications as we use it at the [Atmospheric Modelling Group][2] at 
the University of Helsinki.

To Build
--------

Along the lines of the [original `readme`][3], to build KPP on Ubuntu (I 
have Ubuntu 13.10), you need:

* flex (install Ubuntu package: flex)
* bison (install Ubuntu package: bison)
* `libfl.a` is located at `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfl.a` (if not, use
  `locate libfl.a` to find it). I already added this path to `Makefile.defs`
  so you need to do nothing about this.
* Add something like this to your `.bashrc`

        export KPP_HOME=$HOME/kpp-helsinki
        PATH=$PATH:$KPP_HOME/bin

* Then (here in the project main directory) run `make`. Now you should have
the KPP executable `bin/kpp`.

Main Changes I Made
-------------------

* This should compile on a recent Ubuntu without any edits needed
* Increase MAX_EQN 400 to 10000, MAX_SPECIES 500 to 2000
* Optimization flags to `Makefile.defs`
* Remove some unnecessary files (*.out, *.mod etc.) left by the original
developers (by accident, I assume)

(This README.md is written with [Markdown][4] syntax.)

Installing, on Ubuntu
---------------------

Here are step-by-step instructions to install KPP on Ubuntu Linux.

1.  Run these commands to install some prerequisities:

        sudo apt-get install flex
        sudo apt-get install bison
        sudo apt-get install git

    You might have some of them already installed, but running the install
    command again is not harmful, it will just tell you that the package is
    already installed, and then do nothing.

2.  Next,

        mkdir kpp-helsinki
        cd kpp-helsinki
        git clone https://github.com/samposm/kpp-helsinki.git .

    Note the dot at the end of the third line. At the first and second line,
    you can also create a new directory with some other name, if you like.

3.  Next,

        make

    This will produce a lot of output. If the last line is something like
    `make[1]: Leaving directory ...` then this is a success. If it contains
    some kind of error messages, then something is wrong.

4.  Edit the file `.bashrc` in your home directory, and add the lines

        export KPP_HOME=$HOME/kpp-helsinki
        PATH=$PATH:$KPP_HOME/bin

    (Assuming you used the name `kpp-helsinki` for the directory in step 2,
    and assiming you created the `kpp-helsinki` directly under your home
    directory. Otherwise, modify the first line accordingly.)

5.  Finally, close the shell, and open a new one. Now you can try to run

        kpp

    but without any input files, you will just get an error message:

        Fatal error : 
        Usage :
                kpp <equations file> [output file]
        
        Program aborted


Todo

Increase buffer sizes for longer reaction rate strings, and longer
chemical names.

But the `char str[80];` could be fixed in `scan.y` not in `y.tab.*`.
